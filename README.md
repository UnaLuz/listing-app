# list-frontend-app

I'm currently learning [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and decided to create this very simple web app to practice what I learn.
This was built using plain Vue.js, no Vuex, no Vue Router, etc.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
