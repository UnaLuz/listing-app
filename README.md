# list-frontend-app

I'm currently learning [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and decided to create this very simple web app to practice what I learn.
This was built using plain Vue.js, no Vuex, no Vue Router, etc.

> Managing the state, specifically the list and it's items, would be better using Vuex to avoid emiting events and passing props from component to component but since it's such a small app I decided not to use it and focus on Vue for now.
